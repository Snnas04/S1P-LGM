                    SEASON 11 - 2023
                </div>

                <p>
                    It's finally hereâ€¦ the season we have all been waiting for!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2023, we will see no less than seven manufacturers (Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, Toyota, Glickenhaus and Vanwall) go head-to-head in the FIA World Endurance Championship's headline Hypercar category, with even more marques set to follow in 2024.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, the move to a single GT class is an important step that lays foundations for the future of GT racing in the world's premier endurance series. The scene is set for a very exciting few years ahead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What's more... the 24 Hours of Le Mans - the cornerstone of the FIA WEC - will celebrate its centenary year in June. The calendar also features popular and iconic tracks such as Sebring, Spa, Monza, Fuji and Bahrain, as well as a new addition for 2023: the 6 Hours of Portimao.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The WEC continues to offer teams, drivers, partners and stakeholders a unique stage to compete at some of the world's best race circuits. It also helps offer manufacturers a real-world relevance to advances in road car design and crossover technology, performance and safety.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The comprehensive regulations allow for complex and awe-inspiring sports prototypes, some featuring the latest in hybrid technology, independent chassis and engines suppliers to compete at the highest levels. Furthermore, it allows for some of the world's top luxury car marques to go head-to-head in the ever-competitive GT category.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, only the world's best endurance racers who have proved to be top of their game throughout the season will be worthy of being crowned at the season-closer in Bahrain.  Drivers must prove their skill throughout the season, from the shortest race at 6 hours to the longest at 24 hours.
